DATA COLUMNS IN ATTACHMENT                   

Timestamp: Time and date of the data sample (as seconds since the first instant of 1 January 2001, GMT)                   

Orientation: Sleep position, represented by side-to-side angle of the device in degrees, -180 to 180. Zero for face up, positive values for facing right, negative values for facing left.                   

Inclination: Upright angle of the device (and user) in degrees, 0 to 180. Zero for an upright position (e.g., user standing), 90 for a horizonal position (user lying down), 180 for the unlikely upside-down situation.                   

Time_of_day: Time of the data sample as hours, minutes, and seconds, derived from the Timestamp value, using the device's time zone setting. It gives no additional information, but is provided in a human-readable format for convenient reference.                   

Date: Date of the data sample as year, month and day, derived from the Timestamp value. It gives no additional information, but is provided in a human-readable format for convenient reference. To reduce file size, this is not included on every line.
